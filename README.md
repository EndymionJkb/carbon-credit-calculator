# carbon-credit-calculator

Gather the total carbon credits for a user from a variety of sources: wallet balances, Balancer internal balances, and positions in LP pools with carbon tokens.

Send these using Hyperlane to receivers on L2s to support L2 Dapps.

Did not deploy from this repo; this was part of a larger project, which already had deployment mechanisms.
